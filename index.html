    <p> Hello. My name is Arjun. One of my hobbies is computer
    coding. The coding language I used to make this website is
    HTML. The name of the computer I use is the Raspberry Pi. This is
    what it looks like. </p>

    <p> An accessory that I like to code with is a PiGlow. It has
    programable LED lights. I can use the LXTerminal to set the
    brightness, color, the order of lights, and program how long each
    light stays on. This is what it looks like.  </p>

    <p> On the Raspberry Pi, you can hack the various games. You can hack Snake, Minecraft, and Pong. These are a few
    I have hacked. I have hacked Pokemon as well but that might not be the best to showcase. I hope you have enjoyed
    my little presentation, thank you for your time. </p>
